# Photogallery project

Simple example of Photogallery page build just using Vanilla Javascript - if clicked on small preview, the image will be displayed as a big image on the left side. When scrolled at desktop, the big image stays still on the same spot.

Previews added dynamically by javascript from array - simulating displaying data from database in the real world. If necessary, the simple adding more information to this source array and simple change in the code of the showImage function would make it possible to display dynamically more information about the picture.

**Used technologies:** Vanilla JS, CSS, CSS variables, CSS positioning HTML, SVG
